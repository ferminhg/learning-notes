## Introduction

### What makes a team?

A team is composed of at least two people sharing the same strategic objective. There's no a silver bullet to define what makes a team.

Glosary:

- Teammate: the people you're responsible for as a manager. (enviroment, feedback, performance, reporting, goals, aligment)
- Discipline: the skill set you primarily use at work.
- Functional team: a group of people who work in the same discipline.
- Feature team: a group of people from differente disciplines who work together on a specific feature or product.

Issues when we have a team structure where a manager have direct reports spread across feature teams:

- the manager doesn't have shared context about all their reports' projects.
- different team's strategic objectives

Teams are the atomic unit of any organization. As a manager:

- you must be able to assess and improve dynamic
- defining operations and strategy
- diagnosing any friciton or ambiguity standin

### Stages of group development

Tuckman's stages of group development:

- Forming: setting the stage
- Storming: resolving conflict and tension
- Norming: successfully implementing and sustaining projects
- Performing: expanding initiative and integrating new members

These stage will repleat throughout the lifecycle of the team and can restart when sth changes (people, manager, mission).

### What's in this book
