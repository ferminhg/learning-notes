## Introduction

What makes a team?

A team is composed of at least two people (but, more typically, a handful of people) who share the same strategic objective.

There’s no right or wrong way to define what makes a team.

- **Teammates**: a term I’ll use throughout the book as a catchall for the people you’re responsible for as a manager.
- **Discipline**: the skill set you primarily use at work.
- **Functional team**: a group of people who work in the same discipline.
- **Feature team**: a group of people from different disciplines who work together on a specific feature or product.

As manager might have direct reports spread across feature teams. This structure can cause issues when that manager doesn’t have shared context about all their reports’ projects or priorities, because they’re responsible for a different team’s strategic objectives, and it’s tough to keep all that information in one person’s brain

Teams are the atomic units of any organization, regardless of how it’s been organized; each team’s health contributes to the organization’s overall health. As a manager, you must be able to assess and improve your team’s dynamic—from understanding the individuals that make up the team, to defining the team’s operations and strategy, to diagnosing any friction or ambiguity standing between your team and a healthy state.

These are the four stages a group goes through as it evolves from a bunch of strangers to a unified collective with common goals:

Forming is when the group comes together in its new state.
Storming is where you start to see some friction.
Norming is where things start to iron themselves out.
Performing is that coveted flow state.

These stages will repeat throughout the lifecycle of a team, even if you’ve been together for years. When a new person joins, or a manager changes, or the mission changes, these stages of group development can restart with those Forming stage feelings again.
