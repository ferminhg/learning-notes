# Taking notes

The process is a bit different depending on the medium.

## Books

I do mostly read books on electronic format, so I can highlight and sync cross-device the parts I find most interesting, sometimes with different colours depending on how much the message resonates with me.

After I read a couple of chapters or by the end of the book – right when _recalling_ is most effective – is when I transcribe those highlights down to notes. When transcribing, I do split my screen in two; I open the book with the highlights synced on one side, and the text editor on the other side, so I can transcribe while scanning for highlights. I do not copy and paste the highlights from the book – sometimes this is not even allowed by the reading app because of DRM – I do type every highlight by hand; otherwise there would be no point. I do this for learning and retaining knowledge. Summaries are a side-effect of the process, not the goal.

For writing down the notes, I do usually use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [Markdown TOC extension](https://github.com/huntertran/markdown-toc.git).

Once I have the notes, the idea is to iterate and refine them on successive reading waves, reinforcing the learning.

Taking notes slows down quite a lot the amount of stuff I can ingest, but I found out it really helps me retain knowledge in the long-term. It allows me to come back, review and even share concepts that could be long forgotten otherwise, the slow intake trade-off is compensated.

If you found a more optimal way of doing this, I'd really appreciate hearing about it.
