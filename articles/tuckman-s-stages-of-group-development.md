Tuckman defined 4 phases inevitable in order for a team to grow:

- **Froming**. The team meets and learns about the opportunities and challenges, and the agrees on goals and begins to tackle the tasks. They are very focused on themselves. Dicussion focused in: scope of task, approach, and similar concers. They will need to take risk with the posibility of conflict.
- **Storming**. The team starts to gain each others' trust. A positive and polite atmosphere are arround the team. The team members will start to have some discussions, but tolerance and patience will be the key in this phase. They need to know that they can share their opinions and views. Tension, struggle, and arguments occur.
- **Norming**. Resolved disagreements and personality clashes result in greater intimacy, and a spirit of co-operation emerges. Team members take the responsability and work for the success of the team's goals.
- **Performing**. With group norms and roles established, group members focus on achieving common goals, often reaching an unexpectedly high level of success. The team will make most of the necessary decissions.
